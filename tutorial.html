                    <p class="text-gray-700">Our backend uses FastAPI which is built on Python. To run the backend,
                        first ensure you have python and <a class="text-blue-500 font-bold"
                            href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">poetry</a> installed. After installing these
                        dependencies, navigate to the backend folder and create a poetry shell with <code
                            class="text-red-500 font-bold">poetry shell</code> and install all project dependencies
                        using <code class="text-red-500 font-bold">poetry install</code>. After this, run the following
                        command: <code class="text-red-500 font-bold">uvicorn main:app --reload</code> to start the
                        backend server.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Our frontend uses React. First ensure you <a class="text-blue-500 font-bold"
                            href="https://docs.npmjs.com">NPM</a> installed. After installing NPM, navigate to the
                        frontend folder and run the following command: <code
                            class="text-red-500 font-bold">npm install</code> to install all project dependencies. After
                        this, run <code class="text-red-500 font-bold">npm run dev</code> to start the frontend server.
                        After this, navigate to localhost:5173 (or use whatever port it indicates) to view the frontend.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">After visiting jobquery, you will be greeted by the homepage. Until you
                        login there isn't much functionality offered besides being able to look through the job
                        listings. However, after logging in you will be greeting with a variety of features that can be
                        accessed via the Menu Bar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">After logging in, you will notice some changes to the homepage such as new
                        access to the Menu Bar. This offers new additional features. Continue reading the tutorial to
                        find out how to access and use each of these features.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">While looking through the list of job listings, you may find that you want
                        to save a job to apply to later. This can be done by clicking the "Save Flag" that is in the top
                        right corner of every job listing in the list of jobs seen on the left side of the homepage.</p>
                    <img src="./images/save_jobs_button.png" alt="Click saved jobs flag to save a job." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">A blue "Save Flag" indicates that the job is currently saved, while a clear
                        "Save Flag" indicates that the job is not currently saved. To access all your saved jobs go to
                        the "Saved Jobs" page via the Menu Bar. The saved jobs gives additional options (continue
                        reading to learn what these buttons do) and looks like this: </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">You can easily apply a saved job by clicking "Apply" which brings you to
                        the job's application page, or you can remove a saved job by clicking "Remove". The "CL" button
                        and "Compare" buttons are covered in other sections of this tutorial.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">To access features beyond what is offered by the homepage, you will need to
                        use the dropdown menu which can be opened by clicking your profile picture in the top right
                        corner of the page:</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you need help crafing your resume, go to the "Resume Helper" page in the
                        dropdown menu. From here you can upload either an image (png, jpg, jpeg, etc.) or a pdf of your
                        resume to get a list of suggestions on how to improve your resume. Start by clicking the "Choose
                        File" button:</p>
                    <img src="./images/resume_helper.png" alt="Generate a cover letter." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">After choosing your resume file, click the submit button. From here it will
                        use AI to provide a list of suggestions on what you need to improve in your resume using direct
                        context it obtains from the provided resume.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Job Application Tracker</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you have applied to a lot of jobs at one time, you have probably had a
                        cluttered spreadsheet or text document to keep track of each of the jobs you have applied to and
                        the application's status. JobQuery makes this easier by allowing users to track their
                        application from the site. From the dropdown menu, click "My Applications" to be brought to the
                        application page which looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/application_tracker.png" alt="Application tracker UI page." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Use the "Add New Job" box at the bottom of the page to add jobs you have
                        applied to:</p>
                    <img src="./images/add_job.png" alt="Add a job to application tracker." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Click the "Edit" button on any of the job listings to add additional
                        information. Or click the "Expand" button to reveal additional fields for each tracked
                        application, click "Expand" will make tracked application in the list look like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/expand_application.png" alt="Expand a tracker job application." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Clicking "Collapse" will close the extended view. Clicking "Edit" will make
                        each field for the application editable. Clicking "Save" will save any changes you have made.

                    <p class="text-gray-700">Having a good cover letter is critical for obtaining interviews. To
                        generate an AI generated cover letter, first save a job from the Homepage (see tutorial point
                        2). After saving the job, go to the "Saved Jobs" page from the dropdown menu. To generate a
                        cover letter click the green "CL" button. After this you will confirm your decision to generate
                        a cover letter.</p>
                    <img src="./images/generate_CL_button.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">After the CL is generated, you will get a confirmation. After receiving
                        confirmation, you can go to the "My Cover Letters" page to see the generated cover letter. This
                        page will look like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/cl_dashboard.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%"
                        class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">From this page you can either edit the cover letter you generated (see
                        tutorial step 8) or download or delete the existing cover letter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Editing a Cover Letter</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you are not fully satisfied with the cover letter that has been
                        generated, you can click the "Edit" button on any cover letter in the "Cover Letter Dashboard"
                        page to edit the cover letter. This will bring up an editor with the cover letters contents that
                        looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/cl_editor.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%"

                    <p class="text-gray-700">The editor gives a variety of options such as bold, underlining, font size,
                        headers, etc. After editing the cover letter, click the "Save" button to save the changes you
                        have made. You can also click the "Close" button to close the editor.</p>
                </li>

                        File" button to select a file from your computer, followed by clicking the blue "Upload" button.
                        Once uploaded successfully, your resume will appear in the list below.
                        If you want to preview an uploaded resume, simply click the "View" button next to it to open it
                        directly in your browser.
                        To remove a resume that you no longer need, click the red "Delete" button and confirm your
                        choice to permanently delete it.

                        If you need to make changes, click the yellow "Edit" button. If you don’t need the event
                        anymore, click the red "Delete" button to remove it.
                        You’ll also get an email reminder at the set time to help you stay on track and not miss
