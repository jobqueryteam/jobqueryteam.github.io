                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Step 1: Obtaining JobQuery source code</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Start by downloading or cloning our repo which can be found <a
                            class="text-blue-500 font-bold" href="../tutorial.html">here</a>.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Step 2: Running the backend</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Our backend uses FastAPI which is built on Python. To run the backend,
                        first ensure you have python and <a class="text-blue-500 font-bold"
                            href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/">poetry</a> installed. After installing these
                        dependencies, navigate to the backend folder and create a poetry shell with <code
                            class="text-red-500 font-bold">poetry shell</code> and install all project dependencies
                        using <code class="text-red-500 font-bold">poetry install</code>. After this, run the following
                        command: <code class="text-red-500 font-bold">uvicorn main:app --reload</code> to start the
                        backend server.</p>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Step 3: Running the frontend</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">
                        Our frontend uses React. First ensure you <a class="text-blue-500 font-bold"
                            href="https://docs.npmjs.com">NPM</a> installed. After installing NPM, navigate to the
                        frontend folder and run the following command: <code
                            class="text-red-500 font-bold">npm install</code> to install all project dependencies. After
                        this, run <code class="text-red-500 font-bold">npm run dev</code> to start the frontend server.
                        After this, navigate to localhost:5173 (or use whatever port it indicates) to view the frontend.

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">The Homepage</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">After visiting jobquery, you will be greeted by the homepage. Until you login there isn't much functionality offered besides being able to look through the job listings. However, after logging in you will be greeting with a variety of features that can be accessed via the Menu Bar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Logging In</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">To login into jobquery, press the blue "Login" button that can be see in the top right corner of the page.</p>
                    <img src="./images/login_button.png" alt="Click the login button" width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">After logging in, you will notice some changes to the homepage such as new access to the Menu Bar. This offers new additional features. Continue reading the tutorial to find out how to access and use each of these features.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Saving Jobs</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">While looking through the list of job listings, you may find that you want to save a job to apply to later. This can be done by clicking the "Save Flag" that is in the top right corner of every job listing in the list of jobs seen on the left side of the homepage.</p>
                    <img src="./images/save_jobs_button.png" alt="Click saved jobs flag to save a job." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">A blue "Save Flag" indicates that the job is currently saved, while a clear "Save Flag" indicates that the job is not currently saved. To access all your saved jobs go to the "Saved Jobs" page via the Menu Bar. The saved jobs gives additional options (continue reading to learn what these buttons do) and looks like this: </p>
                    <img src="./images/saved_jobs_page.png" alt="Access the saved jobs page via menu bar" width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">You can easily apply a saved job by clicking "Apply" which brings you to the job's application page, or you can remove a saved job by clicking "Remove". The "CL" button and "Compare" buttons are covered in other sections of this tutorial.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Using the Menu Bar and Dropdown</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">To access features beyond what is offered by the homepage, you will need to use the dropdown menu which can be opened by clicking your profile picture in the top right corner of the page:</p>
                    <img src="./images/dropdown.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">AI Resume Helper</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you need help crafing your resume, go to the "Resume Helper" page in the dropdown menu. From here you can upload either an image (png, jpg, jpeg, etc.) or a pdf of your resume to get a list of suggestions on how to improve your resume. Start by clicking the "Choose File" button:</p>
                    <img src="./images/resume_helper.png" alt="Generate a cover letter." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">After choosing your resume file, click the submit button. From here it will use AI to provide a list of suggestions on what you need to improve in your resume using direct context it obtains from the provided resume.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Job Application Tracker</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you have applied to a lot of jobs at one time, you have probably had a cluttered spreadsheet or text document to keep track of each of the jobs you have applied to and the application's status. JobQuery makes this easier by allowing users to track their application from the site. From the dropdown menu, click "My Applications" to be brought to the application page which looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/application_tracker.png" alt="Application tracker UI page." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Use the "Add New Job" box at the bottom of the page to add jobs you have applied to:</p>
                    <img src="./images/add_job.png" alt="Add a job to application tracker." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Click the "Edit" button on any of the job listings to add additional information. Or click the "Expand" button to reveal additional fields for each tracked application, click "Expand" will make tracked application in the list look like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/expand_application.png" alt="Expand a tracker job application." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Clicking "Collapse" will close the extended view. Clicking "Edit" will make each field for the application editable. Clicking "Save" will save any changes you have made.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">AI Cover Letter Generator</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">Having a good cover letter is critical for obtaining interviews. To generate an AI generated cover letter, first save a job from the Homepage (see tutorial point 2). After saving the job, go to the "Saved Jobs" page from the dropdown menu. To generate a cover letter click the green "CL" button. After this you will confirm your decision to generate a cover letter.</p>
                    <img src="./images/generate_CL_button.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">After the CL is generated, you will get a confirmation. After receiving confirmation, you can go to the "My Cover Letters" page to see the generated cover letter. This page will look like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/cl_dashboard.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">From this page you can either edit the cover letter you generated (see tutorial step 8) or download or delete the existing cover letter.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Editing a Cover Letter</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">If you are not fully satisfied with the cover letter that has been generated, you can click the "Edit" button on any cover letter in the "Cover Letter Dashboard" page to edit the cover letter. This will bring up an editor with the cover letters contents that looks like this:</p>
                    <img src="./images/cl_editor.png" alt="Open the dropdown from the menu bar." width="50%" class="my-4 border-2 border-black" />
                    <p class="text-gray-700">The editor gives a variety of options such as bold, underlining, font size, headers, etc. After editing the cover letter, click the "Save" button to save the changes you have made. You can also click the "Close" button to close the editor.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Resume Folder</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">To manage your resumes, start by uploading one by clicking the "Choose File" button to select a file from your computer, followed by clicking the blue "Upload" button. Once uploaded successfully, your resume will appear in the list below. 
                        If you want to preview an uploaded resume, simply click the "View" button next to it to open it directly in your browser. 
                        To remove a resume that you no longer need, click the red "Delete" button and confirm your choice to permanently delete it. 
                        If you need to save a copy of a resume to your computer, click the green "Download" button to download it.

                <li>
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium">Set Reminder</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700">To manage your events, start by creating a new one. Fill in the title, description, location, start time, and end time in the form. 
                        You can also set a reminder by entering how many minutes before the event you want to be notified and adding your email in the "Reminder Email" field.
